#Creates a graph, well actually 2 graphs layered over each other, one with dots and the other lines connecting those dots

# I can see that math is consistently the highest but that had a pretty severe dip during 2017 in attendence that they are still recoving from.The lines tend to end in the same order they were in at the start too.

ggplot(data = rcw, mapping = aes(x = Semester_Date, y = Count, group = Semester)) + geom_boxplot()
```
The first graph was pretty good, but to get some different insight you can look at this and be able to compare the spread a little better, although it looks to be fairly close, the most recent one there were no outliers, so that was distinct.
