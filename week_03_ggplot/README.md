 Reading Notes for this week:
 
 Consider throughout the article how these concepts apply to English grammar
 
 Scatterplots are done with geom_point(), change x and y in aes()
 
 Aesthetic maps a property of data to a visual element of the graph
 
 Don't match ordered and unordered elements, information is not clear then or lost.
 
 Use facets to use multiple graphs in one image
 
 Transformations of variables is good for some unlike variables
 
 use the fill aesthetic
